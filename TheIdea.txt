Idea: Create a web based application which will allow the creation of flashcards that can then be downloaded to MOBI format, and then downloaded to a Kindle for use on a mobile device. 

Technologies: React (Single Page Application), HTML, CSS, JS, HTML to MOBI converter, 

How to Execute: Single page application, with a form field for two sets of data; answer and prompt. Optional field for "name", which defaults to a number if no name is chosen.
The number follows the number of items created by using the array item id +1 (As an array starts at 0, but we do not start counting at 0). Submit button to create array item. Creation of an array with each submitted data set, with
the array being converted to individual cards. These cards will then be converted into a set of cards, which will be converted to a MOBI format for download to the Kindle.
